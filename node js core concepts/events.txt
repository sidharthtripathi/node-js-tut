to include events functionality in our code

const Emitter = require('events');

// creating a Event object from this class

const myE = new Emitter();

// adding listner to an event

myE.on('foo',()=>{})

// firing the event

myE.emit('foo')

// it has nothing to do with libuv
// pure js

myE.on('foo',()=>{}) // this actually just puts this callback fxn inside a master object
 then when you fire this event using

 myE.emit('foo')
 // all the events inside master object named foo will be executed
 
 - They are placed like an array in object,
    so they will be fired sequentially as they were added in master object
  
To fire event only once use
- myE.once('foo',()=>{})
  instead of
- myE.on('foo',()=>{})

the listner gets removed from master object once fired, upon using
once method
