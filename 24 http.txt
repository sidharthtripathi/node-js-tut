it extends the event emitter class
the server keeps listening to req 
then respond according to the request.
..................
creating a server

const http = require('http')
const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello there')
})       

// req and res are objects
                                    
creates a server and whenever a 
request reaches it executes the callback function
node handles req and we write code to send back response


now invoke listen method passing a port number

server.listen(3000,callbackFxn)
// if you want to execute something as soon as server starts listening
