so well everything inside the computer is binary
when you read file using fs module,
the content is stored as a buffer,

so,
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('file_path')

Now no matter what the data is, it will be in form of binary
that binary is coverted into hex then stored inside buffer


your harddrive is just full of binary data
now a particular section out of it can be a file
 - that file further contains data like
      -location
      -protection
      -name
      -type
-Everything inside a PC is just a file

nodejs -> os -> hard drive 
that's how file management is done by the node js
