Streams -> chunks of data is sent form A to B, instead of the complete
          data in one go
          eg-> downloading a file,streaming a site

Buffers-> suppose a car can transport max of 10 peeps
          50 people come in one go
          then, 10 will go and rest 40 will wait in queue
          (the place where they are waiting is called buffer)

          imagine only 2 person showed up,
          then car won't even move until a minimum no. of passenger
          eg 5 have been filled up
          (its like waiting for data to be processed)
