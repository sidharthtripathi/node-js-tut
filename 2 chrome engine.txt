js can't be understood by computer
we need to convert this js code into machine code
and this is done by our v8 engine


v8 itself is build using c++.
and it is responsible to convert js code into machine code


now what a developer did is use this v8(c++ program) embed this into his own c++ program, and created a new program called node js.
