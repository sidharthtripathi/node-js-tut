some basic diff in api like
browser -> dom, timer , fetch api , bom etc
nodejs -> filesystem, networking etc
.......
Nodejs -> we control the environment, no matter who is using our backend service there won't be any difference
browser-> if he choses an old browser, we have to code according to him
