<div id = 'parent' onclick = 'fxn()'>
parent
  <div id = 'child' onclick = 'fxn()'>
  child
  </div>
</div>

if onclick is triggered for child
for parent it will be executed also

this is called bubbling
from child to its parents then grandparent

and this is caputuring
from parent to child then grandchild


now while adding eventListner
pass the event,callback,boolean

false for bubble
true for caputuring
