use fs module to work around with files
-> reading a file
  -> sync method
  -> async method

-> sync method

const fs = require('node:fs')
const fileData = fs.readFileSync('path_to_file','charEncoding');
// no execution will further proceed until 2nd line is done executing

-> async method

const fs = require('node:fs')
fs.readFile('file.txt','utf-8,(error,data)=>{
  // something wrong occured will be stored in error
  // if file is read successfully, it will be stored into data
})

// this callback function passed will be executed when we are 
    done with reading the file content
...............................................


writing contents to the files 
It also has two methods
-> Sync and Async

by default it overwrites the file

Sync method

fs.writeFileSync('filePath','hi there sir');

Async method

fs.writeFile('filePath','hi there',(err)=>{
  // if some error happens you can show
  // if all works fine you can do whatever the hell you want
})

you can place {flag:'a'} in arguments to append and not overwrite the file
