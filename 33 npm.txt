-> it is package manager

package manager ?
sure you can use packages but,
what if => 
- update arrives on that package
- how devloper is going to push package
- how user is going to use package
- what is name of function or any other stuff gets change in package
- how do I know if this package is dependent on other package

To fix all this package problems a package manager is needed ✌️

npm is default for nodejs 
there are other like yarn and pnpm
