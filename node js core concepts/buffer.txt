earlier we studies about char set, unicode / asci -> char to any number
then we studied about encoding, utf8 -> char to direct binary

just a space of fixed size in memory, whose only purpose is to get and send data

const buffer = Buffer.alloc(8)

// 8 byte buffer allocated in memory and to work with that,
we have given it a name buffer as variable

console.log(buffer) // output
// <buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00> where each 00 represnt a hexadecimal digit and can store data upto 1 byte

1 byte = 8 bits = 0-255 number = 0-ff in hexadecimal

// writing data to buffer

buffer.write('s','utf8')

output becomes // <buffer 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
