all packages are installed with some version 
and the version are written like this, 
  x.y.z
where
-> x = major version
-> y = minor version
-> z = patch

you fix a bug and it is backward compatible, increse z
you add a functionality and still backward compatible, increse y
you make changes to code and is no longer backward compatible, increse x

make sure upon succesful increment, reset the proceeding versions

eg-> 2.3.5
  and you fix the major version, then it becomes -> 3.0.0
  and if you fix minor version, then it becomes -> 2.4.0
  and for path, it becomes -> 2.3.6

- it always start with 0.1.0
- when it is production ready, then go for 1.0.0
