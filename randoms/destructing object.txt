// suppose you create an object

const person = {name:"alan", lastName:"walker, age:34 , city:"new york"}

// now you can acccess the key value pairs using

console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.lastName);

// or you can destructure it using

const {name,lastName} = person;

// now name and lastName are also variable storing that value

// and this is a seperate copy, and has no effect on the original object
