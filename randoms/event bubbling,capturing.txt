by default 
  caputuring then bubbling happens
  you can set whether in the caputuring and bubbling cycle
  the given element will go into caputuring or not
  this cycle goes from top of dom to the element which is clicked

by default the setCapture method is false

there is e -> event object in callback function,
and through which you can stop this cycle right there

(e)=>{
  e.stopPropagation();
}
