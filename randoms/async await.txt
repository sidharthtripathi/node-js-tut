use keyword async before any function and that will become async in nature

async function test(){
  // this will run upon function calling
  // now create promise here
  // its your wish to create promise here
  // you can use promises which are outside this function too,
  // but accessbile in scope
  let p = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    resolve('working');
  })
  // this will run upon function calling 

  let value = await p;
  // this will run after promise get resolve

}


test();
